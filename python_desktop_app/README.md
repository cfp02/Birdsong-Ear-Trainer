# Birdsong Trainer GUI

A desktop application to help you learn and practice identifying warbler songs and calls. The app allows you to browse, filter, and play bird audio files, as well as quiz yourself in various modes.

## Features

- **Bird List View**: Browse all birds and their available sound files (from the Excel database).
- **Audio Playback**: Play any sound file directly from the app.
- **Filter by Sound Type**: Focus your learning by filtering for specific sound types (e.g., "Song", "Call").
- **Quiz/Flashcard Mode (Planned)**: Test your knowledge by playing random sounds and guessing the bird, with the answer revealed after.
- **Custom Playlists (Planned)**: Create and play custom sequences of bird sounds for practice.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3
- [Tkinter](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tkinter.html) (for GUI)
- [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) (for reading Excel database)
- [pygame](https://www.pygame.org/) (for audio playback)

## Setup Instructions

1. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install pandas pygame beautifulsoup4 requests
   ```

2. **Prepare your data:**
   - Place your `birdsong_database.xlsx` (generated by the scraper) in the `birdsong` directory.
   - Ensure your audio files are organized in subfolders by species within the `birdsong` directory.

3. **Run the GUI app:**
   ```bash
   python birdsong_trainer_gui.py
   ```

## Usage
- Use the filter to select which sound types you want to study (e.g., only "Song").
- Browse the list of birds and play their sounds.
- (Planned) Start a quiz or flashcard session to test your knowledge.

## Future Plans
- Add quiz and flashcard modes.
- Allow creation of custom playlists.
- Add more advanced filtering and statistics.
