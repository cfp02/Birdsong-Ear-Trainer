**IMPORTANT**: This README is a living document managed by Projectify and Cursor.
To maintain compatibility and effectiveness:
1. Do not modify the structure of special sections (marked with üö®)
2. Keep all Cursor-specific metadata intact
3. Update the Progress Log with every significant change
4. Use the provided section templates for new content
5. Maintain the established heading hierarchy

## Current Focus
- [‚úÖ] Phase 1: Project Initialization and App Planning
  - [‚úÖ] Define initial feature set and app purpose
  - [‚úÖ] Choose Flutter as the core framework
  - [ ] Begin Flutter project setup
  - [ ] Design UI wireframes and audio flow logic

### 2025-04-10
- Phase: Phase 1 - Project Initialization and App Planning
- Work completed:
  - Defined primary goals of the birdsong training app
  - Decided to use Flutter for web and mobile support
  - Established key features including playback modes, species/group filtering, and audio randomization
- Next steps:
  - Set up initial Flutter app structure
  - Create placeholder UI for species selection and audio control
  - Import and test audio playback with just_audio
- Notes/Challenges:
  - Considering backend storage for sounds and playlists
  - Will explore Xeno-canto API and local file caching

- [ ] Audio playback proof-of-concept
- [ ] Create example dataset of 5 bird calls

### Phase 2: Core Functionality
- [ ] Audio Player UI
  - Play/pause, skip, replay
  - Show species name
- [ ] Playback Modes
  - Single sound
  - Pairs (A then B)
  - Triplets
- [ ] Snippet Logic
  - Full song or 10s clip
  - Store/preprocess snippets

### Phase 3: Bird List & User Controls
- [ ] Species/group selector UI
- [ ] User playlist creation
- [ ] Shuffle/repeat logic

### Phase 4: Progress and Testing
- [ ] Feedback buttons ("I got it right", "wrong")
- [ ] Mark birds as "known" or "practice more"
- [ ] Log response time and accuracy
- [ ] Optional scorekeeping mode

### Phase 5: Media & Offline Support
- [ ] Cloud audio (Xeno-canto or Firebase)
- [ ] Offline caching for audio files
- [ ] Optional spectrogram display

### Phase 6: Advanced Features (Stretch Goals)
- [ ] Mic input for field ID
- [ ] Spectrogram-based guessing
- [ ] Flashcard quiz mode
- [ ] AI-generated hints or descriptions

### Modes
- **Single Call Mode**: One song plays, user guesses.
- **Pair Mode**: Two back-to-back songs, user identifies both.
- **Triplet Mode**: Three songs for harder training.

### Clip Control
- User can toggle between full song or 10-second clips
- Randomized clip start (for realism)

### Group & Species Selection
- Filterable by:
  - Region (e.g., Northeast US)
  - Family (e.g., Warblers)
  - Difficulty (custom tag or metadata)

### Custom List Creation
- Add/remove birds to practice playlist
- Save/load training sets

### User Feedback
- Clickable ‚ÄúCorrect / Incorrect‚Äù tracker
- App adjusts frequency of species based on user accuracy
</details>

## Future Considerations
- Mic recording for live quizzes
- Smart list generation (e.g., "Warblers you're bad at")
- Shareable bird packs or presets
- Embedding training mode in birding apps
- Embedding Xeno-canto license and contributor credits
