### 2024-03-21
- Phase: Phase 2 - Core Functionality
- Work completed:
  - Implemented eBird API integration with secure key handling
  - Created comprehensive bird data models (Bird, BirdList)
  - Built bird selection screen with region filtering
  - Implemented Riverpod state management

## Development Guide
<details>
<summary>Quick Start Guide</summary>

### Dependencies

#### Core Flutter Packages
```yaml
  just_audio: ^0.9.36
  flutter_riverpod: ^2.4.9
  path_provider: ^2.1.1
  http: ^1.1.0
  flutter_dotenv: ^5.1.0
```

#### Setup
1. Install Flutter SDK and run:
   ```bash
   flutter doctor
   ```

2. Create new Flutter app:
   ```bash
   flutter create birdsong_trainer
   cd birdsong_trainer
   ```

3. Add dependencies to `pubspec.yaml`

4. Set up eBird API key:
   - Create `.env` file in project root
   - Add `EBIRD_API_KEY=your_key_here`

5. Run app on desired platform:
   ```bash
   flutter run -d chrome   # for web
   flutter run -d android  # for Android device
   flutter run -d ios      # for iOS
   ```

## Project Roadmap
<details>
<summary>View complete project phases</summary>

### Phase 1: Foundation & Planning âœ…
- [âœ…] Project idea and scope definition
- [âœ…] Tool and framework selection (Flutter)
- [âœ…] App skeleton creation (routing, state management)
- [âœ…] Create example dataset of 5 bird calls

### Phase 2: Core Functionality ðŸ”„
- [âœ…] Audio Player UI
  - Play/pause, skip, replay
  - Show species name
- [âœ…] Playback Modes
  - Single sound
  - Pairs (A then B)
  - Triplets
- [âœ…] Snippet Logic
  - Full song or 10s clip
  - Store/preprocess snippets

### Phase 3: Bird List & User Controls ðŸ”„
- [âœ…] Species/group selector UI
- [âœ…] User playlist creation
- [ðŸ”„] Shuffle/repeat logic
- [ ] Region-based filtering
- [ ] Family-based filtering

### Phase 4: Progress and Testing
- [ ] Feedback buttons ("I got it right", "wrong")
- [ ] Mark birds as "known" or "practice more"
- [ ] Log response time and accuracy
- [ ] Optional scorekeeping mode

### Phase 5: Media & Offline Support
- [ðŸ”„] Cloud audio (Xeno-canto or Firebase)
- [ ] Offline caching for audio files
- [ ] Optional spectrogram display

### Phase 6: Advanced Features (Stretch Goals)
- [ ] Mic input for field ID
- [ ] Spectrogram-based guessing
- [ ] Flashcard quiz mode
- [ ] AI-generated hints or descriptions

### Modes
- **Single Call Mode**: One song plays, user guesses.
- **Pair Mode**: Two back-to-back songs, user identifies both.
- **Triplet Mode**: Three songs for harder training.

### Clip Control
- User can toggle between full song or 10-second clips
- Randomized clip start (for realism)

### Group & Species Selection
- Filterable by:
  - Region (e.g., Northeast US)
  - Family (e.g., Warblers)
  - Difficulty (custom tag or metadata)

### Custom List Creation
- Add/remove birds to practice playlist
- Save/load training sets

### User Feedback
- Clickable "Correct / Incorrect" tracker
- App adjusts frequency of species based on user accuracy
</details>

## Future Considerations
- Mic recording for live quizzes
- Smart list generation (e.g., "Warblers you're bad at")
- Shareable bird packs or presets
- Embedding training mode in birding apps
- Embedding Xeno-canto license and contributor credits
